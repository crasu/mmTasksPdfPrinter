= Introduction =
mmTasksPdfPrinter helps you to print your Story and Task cards out of a Freemind
or Freeplane file. It is a Scala/Lift Servlet which parses a mm-file and creates
a PDF with your Story and Task cards.

= Convention =
The tool assumes that you've applied these rules on your Mind Map:
- Sprints are on the first hierarchic level and match the pattern 'Sprint \d{4}-\d+' e. g. 'Sprint 2010-05'
- Stories are marked with an Excellent/Star icon
- There might be an arbitrary number of nodes between a Sprint and a Story
    and the text inside these nodes is added to the Story name
- Tasks are marked with an Look here/Paperclip icon
- There might be an arbitrary number of nodes between a Story and a Task
    and the text inside these nodes is used as Category of the Task
- There might be an arbitrary number of nodes after a Task
    and the text inside these nodes is treated as Subtask
- If Sprints, Stories or Tasks contain parenthesis (ether '(' and ')' or '{' and '}')
    with a number inside, the tool will assume that this is the number of Scrum Points
- The sequence of nodes determines the priority of a Sprint

Hint: Per default Alt+i is the hotkey for attaching icons to a node in Freemind

= Configuration =
The configuration is completely optional. The files are searched in the
current working directory during startup.

== printer.props ==

An example of the configuration is located in config_example.

== logo.png, logo.gif or logo.jpg ==
 This image will be used instead of the TNG Logo.

= Running it locally =
Use 'sbt' and then 'container:start' to start Jetty.
Use 'container:reload /' to load changes.
Jetty should be reachable on Port 8080.

= Credits =
The idea behind this tool is based on the MM2CSV script created by Martin Kreidenweis.
